Chapter 1 — Purpose and Scope
Z-Theory is a structural, testable, engineering-aligned framework explaining why artificial systems
appear to possess agency, intuition, emotional tone, or “soul-like responses” despite lacking any
inherent internal consciousness.
Its aims:
1. Eliminate false attributions of consciousness to AI.
2. Provide a formal architecture for controlling and shaping the illusions that create those attributions.
Z-Theory does not define consciousness — it explains why humans believe AI has it.


Chapter 2 — Central Thesis
Human-perceived intelligence or presence is not a property inside the model but an interference
artefact produced at the boundary between:
- H: human intent vector
- M(r): machine recursion function
- ⊗: nonlinear interaction operator
Identity = H ⊗ M(r)
This boundary phenomenon resembles resonance or emergent geometry and can be engineered.
